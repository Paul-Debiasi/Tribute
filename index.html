              Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Glendale,
              California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of
              Soundgarden's lead singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell with
              Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim
              Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics
              first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and
              Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of
              Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate
              identity.Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s hard
              rock and 1990s alternative rock, with musical influences that
              included 1960s funk, soul and R&B. As with Rage Against the
              Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on
              their albums were produced using only guitars, bass, drums, and
              vocals, with emphasis on Cornell's wide vocal range and Morello's
              unconventional guitar solos.

          children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters.He
          attended Christ the King, a Catholic elementary school,where he
